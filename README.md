# Advent of Code

Welcome to my Advent of Code playground: a collection of puzzle solutions implemented in Python to practice problem solving, algorithms, and clean code. I use these daily challenges to explore different approaches, test my knowledge, and improve my coding skills by turning puzzle descriptions into reliable, well-documented programs.

**Why this repo**: Advent of Code provides compact, interesting problems that force you to think about parsing, algorithms, and edge cases. Solving them in Python is a great way to sharpen debugging, testing, and optimization skills in real problem scenarios.

**Structure**

- `day1.py`, `day2.py`, ... : Python solution scripts for puzzles.
- `day1.txt`, `day2.txt`, ... : Puzzle input files corresponding to each solution.

**How I use it**

- Solve each day's puzzle in a focused script: parse the input, implement one or two solution functions (part 1 and part 2), and print results.

Each script reads its input file (e.g., `day1.txt`) and only prints the answer for second part (if completed).

**Notes**

- This repo is primarily a personal learning sandbox. I often write solutions quickly during the challenge, so some scripts may not be the cleanest or most readable. The implementations prioritize correctness and getting the job done over perfect style—use them as learning references, not production-quality libraries.
